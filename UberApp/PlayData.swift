    //  First, the parameter is called filter, which means that's how we can refer to it inside applyFilter(). Then we have (String), which means this parameter is a function that accepts a single string parameter. Finally, we have -> Bool, which means the function should return a boolean.

    //For Example
//    It's possible to have as many of these as I want, so we could have written a method that accepts three filters if we wanted to:
//
//    func applyFilter(_ filter1: (String) -> Bool, filter2: (Int) -> String, filter3: (Double)) { }
    
    //for the above example: In that code, filter2 must be a function that accepts an integer parameter and returns a string, and filter3 must be a function that accepts a double and returns nothing.
